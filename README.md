# GeoDataCovid19Dataset
Goal: Extraction of a dataset of eographical/meteorological data to be used for the study of the diffusion of COVID19.

Initial plan is to focus on Europe and the US due to readily available data. Information should have daily frequency. Proposed columns for the dataset are:

1. Date
2. Geographic coordinates
3. Name of location (if needed)
4. Nation
5. Local population density (note that this might change during the day! How to take this into consideration?)
6. Average, maximal, minimal temperature
7. Same for humidity
8. Same for pressure
9. Altitude
10. UV exposure
11. Flags for lockdowns, social distncing, school closures, and similar measures
